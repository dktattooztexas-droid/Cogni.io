# Cogni

> Powered by Google Cloud Platform & Hugging Face

Your intelligent command-line and system analysis co-pilot.

Cogni is a powerful, AI-driven assistant designed for power users, developers, and system administrators. It acts as an expert partner, helping you navigate your system, analyze data, and enhance your productivity by bridging the gap between natural language and complex system operations.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **ü§ñ Expert AI Chat:** Engage in real-time conversations with an AI that understands system administration, coding, and data analysis.
-   **üñ•Ô∏è Screen Analysis:** Share your screen for contextual help with GUIs, code, or any visual information. The AI can "see" what you're working on to provide specific, relevant assistance.
-   **‚å®Ô∏è Command Generation:** Cogni's core feature. Ask it to perform a system-level task, and it will generate the precise terminal command for you to run. It's an expert that knows the flags, pipes, and syntax you need.
-   **üìã Output Analysis:** Paste the output from a command, a log file, or any text-based data, and Cogni will analyze it, summarize it, find errors, and provide actionable insights.
-   **üß† Deep Analysis:** Upload exported files like browser history (`.json`), logs (`.txt`), or data sheets (`.csv`) for a comprehensive overview and efficiency suggestions.

## üöÄ The Cogni Workflow

Cogni empowers you by pairing your control with its intelligence. Here‚Äôs the primary workflow:

### 1. The Ask: From Intent to Command

Instead of trying to remember a complex command, simply tell Cogni what you want to achieve.

> **Example:** "Show me the 10 largest files in my home directory"
> **Example:** "Find all processes using more than 500MB of memory"
> **Example:** "Scan the system log for any disk error messages from the last hour"

Cogni will process your request and generate the exact command needed, displaying it in the **Terminal View**.

### 2. The Execution: You Are in Control

1.  Click the **Copy Icon** in the Terminal View to copy the generated command.
2.  Paste the command into your computer's actual terminal (e.g., Terminal, iTerm, Windows Terminal).
3.  Press `Enter` to run it.

This model ensures that no command is ever run without your explicit action, providing total security and control.

### 3. The Analysis: From Data to Insight

1.  Copy the output generated by the command in your terminal.
2.  Paste the output directly into the Cogni chat. You can add context if you like.

> **Example:** "Here's the output. What does it mean?"

Cogni will analyze the pasted data and give you a clear, human-readable explanation, identify key information, and suggest next steps. This is perfect for interpreting dense log files, understanding system reports, or debugging program outputs.

### 4. File-Based Analysis

For broader analysis:

1.  Use your browser's "Export History" feature or locate a log file you want to analyze.
2.  In the **Productivity Tools** panel, click **"Upload & Analyze File"**.
3.  Select the file (`.json`, `.txt`, `.md`, `.csv`).
4.  Cogni will perform a detailed analysis of the file's contents and present a full report in the chat.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Running

This application is a static web app that runs entirely in the browser.

### Prerequisites

-   A modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).
-   A valid Google Gemini API Key.

### Configuration

The application requires a Google Gemini API key to function. This key must be made available as an environment variable named `API_KEY`.

**The application is built to read this key from its execution environment automatically. You do not need to modify the source code.**

### Running the Application

1.  Ensure the `API_KEY` environment variable is set in your deployment or local environment.
2.  Serve the project files using any static file server.
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. Cogni will be ready to use.
